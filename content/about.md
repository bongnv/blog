# Hi, I'm Bong

I currently work at Grab as a lead software engineer. Formerly, I was a backend software engineer at TinTin (a fintech startup), and a game developer at Gameloft. Regarding my education, I graduated from Hanoi University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Before that, I was born and raised in Ninh Binh, Vietnam.

My focus is on distributed systems in [Go](https://golang.org/) programing language. Meanwhile, I'm also interested in frontend technologies like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). In general, I like to write codes and I like to solve problems that have an impact on people's lives.

Beside, here is my wife & me:
